Capstone Project Autonomous Driving
Domain and Context
Briefly detail the domain in which your work will be done. Give as much context as you can about the domain and why the problem you intend to solve is important within this domain. 
Currently autonomous driving is an area of interest and research. We would like to solve a problem in this domain and for solving similar instance segmentation problems.

Car manufacturers are widely using Artificial Intelligence to offer variety of smart solutions in the automotive industry. One such solution is Autonomous/Self driving cars. However, to develop car which is completely autonomous in nature, it should be able to identify varied range of objects just like humans are able to recognize in real life.
Our team's approach is to use Advance Computer Vision techniques such as Semantic segmentation and instance segmentation to help AI enabled cars to identify different objects while driving and respond accordingly.
Our target is to help AI enabled cars understand and differentiate between different objects like car, motorcycle, bicycle, pedestrian, truck, bus, and tricycle.
Our team's approach is to use Advance Computer Vision techniques such as Semantic segmentation and instance segmentation to help AI enabled cars to identify different objects while driving and respond accordingly.
The scope of this project includes identifying each object instance of each pixel for every known object within an image, which are car, motorcycle, bicycle, pedestrian, truck, bus, and tricycle. Detect these objects efficiently by performing detection and segmentation for self-driving cars. While driving, it is highly important to be able to quickly detect objects, the difference between them whether it is a vehicle, person â€¦etc.
